<h1> CV - Admin </h1>

<p> I have developed this Grails - groovy application to manage my online resume. <br/>
Indeed, I have developed an <a href="https://github.com/sofianeOuafir/cv/tree/master"> AngularJs app </a> based on a RESTFUL API which is this Grails back-end application.
</p>
<p> This application allow me to manage my work experiences, everything related to my diplomas, my interests, professional skills and finally, allow me to manage the description of myself.</p>

<p>This application is deployed on a Tomcat 7 Server and secured thanks to the <strong> spring's security core plugin </strong> which make sure that only authorized person can manage the data. </p>

<p>Behind that, there is a mysql database server to store the data. </p>

<p>This is a RestFul application, which means that I have the frontend and the backend who works together without knowing anything about each other. The frontend (AngularJs) makes requests to the backend (Grails) which will respond with JSON objects. </p>
